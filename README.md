## Topic: Machine Learning Applied to Cervical Cancer Data

- Given a dataset with 36 columns
  - 32 feature columns, 4 target columns
- Created a model using KNN to predict presence of cervical cancer for given feature values for a patient.

### To run the program:

> Note: To run the program we need Cervical_cancer.ipynb file (available in implementation folder) and cervical-cancer.csv (available in data folder) downloaded

#### Step 1: Go to [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

#### Step 2: Select upload

![Second step](images/second_step.png)

#### Step 3: Drag and drop Cervical_cancer.ipynb file

![Third step](images/third_step.png)

#### Step 4: Run cell number one and choose cervical-cancer.csv

![Third step](images/fourth_step.png)

#### Step 5: Run cells in sequential manner to get output

### Conclusion:

- The data was biased as the huge number of 0's in the dataset affected the output.
- Confusion matrix confirms the paper conclusion of data being biased

Thank you
